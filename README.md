## Credits

  In this application starter code was provided that ran a fully functioning Book search app with a RESTful API. The challenge was to refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. I have used many of the strategies taught by the excellent instructors at the UC Berkeley Extension Full Stack coding bootcamp. In this case I used variations of methods taught in units 20 & 21, which deal with React, Vite npm, the MERN stack, the Apollo server and GraphQL queries.  Finally, I copied open source badges from Vedant Chainani at the website https://dev.to/envoy_/150-badges-for-github-pnk#contents
